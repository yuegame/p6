Individual_Grid
	Our generate_successors function uses elitist selection by picking the strongest 
and passing them on without reproducing/mutating and tournament selection by randomly 
reproducing with less than half of the most fit members of the population, favoring 
those with higher fitness. The elitist selection ensured that the fitness level will 
definitely not decrease, while the roulette selection tried its best to make more fit 
children.

The mutation function has:
A small chance of creating something other than pipe pieces 
and solid walls from an empty space. (0.6% for each empty space)

A small chance of removing something other than pipe pieces 
and solid walls, replacing with empty space. (0.5% for each qualifying option)

A chance that a block (B,?, or M) will extend to the right, creating a platform
as long as the area to the right is empty.
(1% to add a Mushroom block)
(9% to add a Question block)
(35% to add a Breakable block)
(10% to add a solid block)

A chance that a 'floating' solid block will extend to the right, creating a platform
as long as the area to the right is empty.
(2% to add a Breakable block)
(2% to add a solid block)

A chance to generate 'stairs' when there are two solid blocks side by side horizontally
To get more verticality and avoid creating a second layer of solid ground:
 ---- => --X- higher chance to add a stair when the adjacent blocks are also 
 -XX-    -XX- surrounded by empty spaces (40% to add a solid block)

  X-  =>  XX  higher chance to build near other, higher ground
  XX      XX  (30% to add a solid block)
 
  --  => -X   small chance to begin 'stairs' (2% for every pair of horizontally adjacent solid blocks)
  XX  => XX   (70% stairs will lead to upper right, 30% they will lead to upper left)
 
A chance to start a gap in the solid ground as long as the ground is not supporting pipes
 --- => ---   (2% to add a gap in the middle of three horizontally adjacent solid blocks)
 XXX    X-X (3% chance the gap will extend to the right by one)
   
Gets rid of objects that clip into pipes
 TB  => T-    replaces spaces to the right of pipes with empty space
 |o     |-
 
 B?  => --  replaces spaces above the pipe with empty spaces
 T-     T- 
 
A chance to create a pipe above solid ground, as long as it wont collide with other existing pipes
 ---    -T-  (2% for each three horizontally adjacent solid blocks)
 --- => -|-  (50% chance the pipe will be one "|" taller)
 XXX    XXX  (70% chance this taller pipe will get even taller)

If there happens to be any rogue, floating pipe pieces, it will remove them

90% chance to remove Question and Mushroom blocks if they are blocked by solid ground
 ?-M => ---
 XXX    XXX

30% chance to remove Question and Mushroom blocks if they are blocked by Breakable blocks
 ?-M => ---
 BBB    BBB
 
75% chance to remove enemies if they are spawned within 3 cols of mario's spawn

A very small chacne to not mutate the individual at all.


Individual_DE

	The Individual_DE's crossover uses a strange single-point crossover, creating two 
children made with the parts of both parents chosen by two random points. The first child has 
the front part of the first parent up to the first point and the back part of second parent 
starting from the second point, while the second child has the front part of the second 
parent up to the second point and the back part of the first parent starting from the first point.

	The mutation function mutates blocks into different things or shifts them based on what they 
originally were. A block has a 1/3 chance to shift left/right, 1/3 chance to shift up/down, 
and a 1/3 chance to become breakable/unbreakable. A question block has 1/3 chance to shift 
left/right, 1/3 chance to shift up/down, and a 1/3 chance to gain/lose a powerup. Coins and 
pipes just have a 1/2 chance to shift left/right and a 1/2 chance to shift up/down. A hole 
has a 1/2 chance to shift left/right and a 1/2 chance to grow wider/narrower. Stairs have a 
1/3 chance to shift left/right, a 1/3 chance to get taller/shorter, and a 1/3 chance to 
switch the direction they face. Platforms have a 1/4 chance to shift left/right, a 1/4 
chance to get wider/narrower, a 1/4 chance to shift up/down, and a 1/4 chance to change 
what they're made of. Enemies are ignored in the mutation process.

Changes: Negative linearity is now more prioritized. Since the original mutate function doesn't 
actually make any new DEs out of nothing, the mutate function has been changed to do that now. In 
order to avoid the list of genomes from getting too long, the genome pops an element off before 
adding a new random genome once the list gets to a certain length. This happens independent of 
the shifting/changing done in the original mutate function, as the original required the list not 
being empty. These changes caused the level to be more interesting, but cluttered up if it was 
let run for too long.
