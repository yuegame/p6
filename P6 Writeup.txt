Individual_DE

	The Individual_DE's crossover uses a strange single-point crossover, creating two 
children made with the parts of both parents chosen by two random points. The first child has 
the front part of the first parent up to the first point and the back part of second parent 
starting from the second point, while the second child has the front part of the second 
parent up to the second point and the back part of the first parent starting from the first point.

	The mutation function mutates blocks into different things or shifts them based on what they 
originally were. A block has a 1/3 chance to shift left/right, 1/3 chance to shift up/down, 
and a 1/3 chance to become breakable/unbreakable. A question block has 1/3 chance to shift 
left/right, 1/3 chance to shift up/down, and a 1/3 chance to gain/lose a powerup. Coins and 
pipes just have a 1/2 chance to shift left/right and a 1/2 chance to shift up/down. A hole 
has a 1/2 chance to shift left/right and a 1/2 chance to grow wider/narrower. Stairs have a 
1/3 chance to shift left/right, a 1/3 chance to get taller/shorter, and a 1/3 chance to 
switch the direction they face. Platforms have a 1/4 chance to shift left/right, a 1/4 
chance to get wider/narrower, a 1/4 chance to shift up/down, and a 1/4 chance to change 
what they're made of. Enemies are ignored in the mutation process.
